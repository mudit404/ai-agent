# Intelligent Assistants Builder

## Overview
This project is a No-Code/Low-Code web application that empowers users to create intelligent assistants using OpenAGI, an open-source toolkit for building autonomous agents. Users can visually design workflows by connecting pre-built components for OpenAGI's agents, large language models (LLMs), and tools. By leveraging these components, users can build their own intelligent helpers to simplify tasks and achieve their goals.

## Features
- Visual interface for designing intelligent assistant workflows
- Support for various LLMs (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI GPT-3.5, OpenAI GPT-4)
- Ability to create and configure agents and tools
- Drag-and-drop component library
- Authentication and user management
- Build and run workflows

## Technologies
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: Kubernetes (Optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)

- Kubernetes (Optional)

### Setup Instructions

#### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-assistants-builder.git

    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database:
    ```bash
    # Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
    createdb intelligent_assistants_db

    # Run migrations (assuming you have alembic configured)
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

5. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
